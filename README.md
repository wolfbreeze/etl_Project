Project Proposal

Our data source for the project will be CSV files from kKggle.com for crime reports of 3 Major meteropolitian (Chicago, New York, & Los Angeles)
Concentrating on data from the year 2017, we will start cleaning the data by removing all non-violent crimes. 

Our end product will be a relational database breakdown counts in each metroploitain area of the four major violent crimes (Homicide, Rape, Robbery, Aggravated Assault)
